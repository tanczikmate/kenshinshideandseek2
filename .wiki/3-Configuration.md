## Localization
**This section is for the locale.yml file**

This file is simple, it allows you to change the text of messages that the plugin uses.

## Leaderboard
**This section is for the board.yml file**

This config file allows you to change what is displayed on the scoreboard\leaderboard while in the lobby, or in the game. Below are a list of predefined placeholders.

#### LOBBY BOARD PLACEHOLDERS

| Name | Description |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| {COUNTDOWN} | Displays the time left in the lobby countdown. If there are not enough people in the lobby, or the lobby countdown its disabled, it just displays waiting for players. The text displayed can be changed below. |
| {COUNT} | The amount of player currently in the lobby. |
| {SEEKER%} | The chance that a player will be selected to be a seeker. |
| {HIDER%} | The chance that a player will be selected to be a hider. |
| {MAP} | The current map that the game is on. |

#### GAME BOARD PLACEHOLDERS

| {TIME} | The amount of time left in the game in MmSs. |
| {TEAM} | The team you are on. Hider, Seeker, or Spectator. |
| {BORDER} | The current status of the world boarder, if enabled. If the world border is disabled, this line is removed automatically. Displays the time left until the border moves in MmSs, or "Decreasing" if it's decreasing. What is displayed exactly can be changed below. |

You can use these placeholders to specify the content of the leaderboards on the side of the screen in both the lobby and while in game. You can also set the specific types of text different placeholders will return as well in the config file.

## Items
**This section is for the items.yml file**

If you have pvp enabled, this file will specify what items each player will get. There are two sections for items, one for hiders, and one for seekers. Spectators don't get any items. Below is a table on the parameters, and some examples on some premade items.
